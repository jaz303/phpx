Parser
    X read entire PHP file and assemble it into some structure
    X classes should be stored as instances of ClassDef
    X Namespace support
    X Abstract classes
    X Magic methods for assigning access qualifiers
    
    
Modify parser to support features:

    X eval{}
    X delegation
    X mixins
    - pattern matching
    
Other features:

    - forward declarations
    - allow delegates to implement multiple interfaces
    
Last mile stuff:

    X stream loader
    X auto loader
    - caching
      - mtime check
        define('PHPX_MTIME_CHECK', true);
        define('PHPX_MTIME_CHECK', 'functionname');
    X macro registration, with some way of delayed loading
    
Possible bugs:

    - type-hinted classes don't get leading slash for namespace
    - parser doesn't recognise "final"
    - parser doesn't recognise methods returning by reference
    - mixing in class implementing interface should cause recipient to implement interface
    - prevent duplicate interfaces
